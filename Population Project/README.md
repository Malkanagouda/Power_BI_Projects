# üåé World Population Analysis Dashboard  

This Power BI project offers **dynamic insights into global population trends** using interactive visualizations and data analysis. Explore demographic patterns, population growth, age-wise distribution, and regional disparities. The project contains a large dataset that has been analyzed thoroughly using **Power BI** for better understanding and actionable insights.  

---

## üîé Project Overview  
The dashboard focuses on understanding **world population trends** across countries and demographic groups. Users can:  
- Explore population of each country  
- Compare male and female population distributions  
- Analyze population by age groups and regions  
- Identify top countries by population and regional disparities  

The project leverages **Power BI‚Äôs interactive capabilities** to make complex datasets easy to analyze and visualize.

## üéØ Objective  
The main objectives of this project are:  
- To understand the population of each country  
- To analyze male and female population distribution  
- To explore trends in global population growth  
- To visualize population by region, age group, and country

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process Overview  
The project follows the **ETL process** in Power BI:  

1. **Extract:**  
   - Open Power BI Desktop  
   - Extract data from Excel files (`Population 1950-1999`, `Population 2000-2049`, `Population 2050-2100`) and a text file (`code-country-region`)  

2. **Transform:**  
   - Clean and preprocess data using Power Query Editor  
   - Remove unwanted columns, unpivot columns, split and rename columns, replace values  
   - Create a star schema with Dimensional tables (`Age`, `Region`) and Fact table (`Population`)  

3. **Load:**  
   - Load the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI Desktop for modeling and visualization

## üìä Data Preparation  
Steps involved in data preparation:  
- Extracted data from multiple sources (Excel and text files)  
- Transformed data by cleaning, unpivoting, renaming, and splitting columns  
- Created data models using **Star Schema**:  
  - **Dimensional Age**  
  - **Dimensional Region**  
  - **Fact Population**

## üìà Data Visualization  
The dashboard uses various interactive visuals to represent population insights:  
- **Text visual:** Headings and section titles  
- **Line chart:** Population trends by age group  
- **Clustered bar chart:** Top 10 countries with the highest population  
- **Pie chart:** Population distribution by age group  
- **Clustered column chart:** Population by region  
- **Map visual:** Population of each country  
- **Slicers:** Filter by country and year  
- **Card visual:** Sum of population, male population, and female population  
- **DAX calculations:** Measures for male and female population  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated  
- **Data Extraction & Transformation:** Power Query for cleaning and shaping large datasets  
- **Data Modeling:** Star schema with dimensional and fact tables  
- **DAX Calculations:** Measures for population breakdowns and insights  
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Maps, charts, slicers, and cards  
- **Business Intelligence:** Translating large datasets into actionable insights

## üìå Conclusion  
This project demonstrates the power of **Power BI** in analyzing and visualizing complex datasets. By performing extraction, transformation, and loading, we have created a **comprehensive interactive dashboard** that allows users to explore:  
- Global population trends  
- Age-wise population distribution  
- Male vs. female population ratios  
- Regional disparities and top populous countries  

The dashboard provides an easy way to **gain insights from large datasets** and make **data-driven decisions**.
